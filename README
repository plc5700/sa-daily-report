This script is designed to be run on a daily basis, i.e. as a cron job or
similar on a machine that is using amavisd-new and SpamAssassin to filter
incoming mail. This script is of use if you wish to recieve a report each
day of all the emails that SpamAssassin has marked as spam and amavisd-new
has consequently quarantined in its quarantine directory, so that you can
check for false positives. The report consists of the 'To', 'From' and
'Subject' headers of each email, plus the spam score SpamAssassin gave it.

The only things that should need changing below are:
  @directory - amavisd-new's quarantine directory.
  @to_name - the name of the person recieving the report
  @to_address - the email address the report is to be sent to
  @server - the outgoing SMTP server to use
And possibly:
  @port - the port the SMTP server is running on. Defaults to 25.

Once you have configured this script correctly you should then set up the
cron job to run this each day. It scans all of the emails in the quarantine
directory from the previous day, so I usually run it at 1 a.m., so that the
report of yesterday's spam is waiting for me each morning.
